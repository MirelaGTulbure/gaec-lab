Dr. Perin worked to quantify on-farm reservoir dynamics over the course of four PhD papers. He utilized data from Landsat, Sentinel 1 and 2, Planet, and Planet Fusion datasets throughout his work and was published in both Ag Water Management and Remote Sensing of Environment. 

Vini successfully completed his PhD in an astonishing 3 years with Dr. Mirela Tulbure as his main advisor. Moving forward, he will be working with Planet and we all wish him luck!
