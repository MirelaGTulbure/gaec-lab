The lab is given a Collaboration and Innovation Award at the Fourth Annual CGA Awards. 

<!--more-->

This award is given to a research team who collaborates across disciplinary boundaries to address environmental and societal challenges. Specifically, our work developing advanced methods to improve flood detection using fused satellite data from multiple sensors across large geographical extents. To do this, we brought together engineers, data and remote sensing scientists, applies statisticians and hydrologists from NC State, University of New South Wales, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, State University of New York, Syracuse, and University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. 

This is the same work that was <a href="../22-09-20-nasa-feature/">highlighted by NASA</a> last year.
