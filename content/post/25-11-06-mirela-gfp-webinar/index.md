The Global Flood Partnership is a multi-disciplinary group that connects scientists with flood disaster managers to improve flood prediction and management efforts. The upcoming fall webinar series focuses on Earth Observation data and will feature three presenters, including Dr. Tulbure. 

Dr. Tulbure will present her recent work on large-scale flood mapping using multi-sensor fusion and Geospatial Foundation Models. The study integrates data from over 85 global flood events into a single training dataset to refine foundation models such as ESA-IBM’s TerraMind. This work lays the groundwork for near-real-time flood mapping, which can be utilized for disaster response and flood risk management.
