summary: Researchers in Australia and Sweden have used graph theory to show that the connectivity of aquatic habitats in the Swan Coastal Plain – a global biodiversity hotspot – has fallen over the past 13 years. The study reveals which bodies of water function as vital “stepping stones” to connect other habitats, and highlights the potential importance of the analysis technique for conservation.
