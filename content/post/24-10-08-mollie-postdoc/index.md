During her time in the Ph.D. program, she used satellite imagery to quantify surface water in the southeastern US and completed three dissertation chapters. Two chapters have already been published and the third is currently under review. Dr. Gaines was also a <a href = "https://science.nasa.gov/sciact-team/smd-community-of-practice-for-education/"> NASA ScOPE</a> Affiliate and finished her Ph.D. with funding from a NASA FINESST grant. While in the Ph.D. program, she was an active member of the Geospatial Graduate Student Organization and served as Co-President for 2 years.

Dr. Gaines is excited to continue working with Dr. Tulbure in the GAEC lab. In upcoming work, she will be applying deep learning to Sentinel-2 imagery to detect small artificial water bodies in North Carolina. She is measuring methane from a sample of the water bodies in order to further explore and quantify the contribution of methane emission from them.
