Dr. Perin’s 4th PhD Chapter, “Assessing the cumulative impact of on-farm reservoirs on modeled surface hydrology” has been published with support from GAEC lab principal investigator Dr. Mirela G. Tulbure and committee member Dr. Sankar Arumugam.

The authors developed a novel framework to estimate how hundreds of on-farm reservoirs alter surface water flows. The framework combines a remote-sensing time-series algorithm with the SWAT+ hydrological model and was created to be replicable in other regions. 

This approach can be utilized by water-resource agencies to gain insight into how small waterbodies influence watershed hydrology under rising irrigation demand and climate stress. Congratulations to the authors.
