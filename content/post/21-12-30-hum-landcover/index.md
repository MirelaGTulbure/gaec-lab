<a href = "https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rse2.248">"Regional matters: On the usefulness of regional land-cover datasets in times of global change"</a> was published in Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation in December 2021.

This publication discusses the development of global-EO land-cover and land-use data sets and the relative advantages and disadvantages of regional and global datasets. As global changes impacts manifest in regions it is critical that EO data embraces the idea that regions matter.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The free availability of global satellite data archives, increased computational power &amp; open-source algorithms have led to a proliferation of global Earth Observation (EO) <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/landcover?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#landcover</a> data. Does that mean that regional EO land-cover data are no longer needed? <a href="https://t.co/AWTG6a7Jdo">pic.twitter.com/AWTG6a7Jdo</a></p>&mdash; Dr. Mirela G.
