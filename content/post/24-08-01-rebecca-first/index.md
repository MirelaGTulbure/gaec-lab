Hurricane Ida brought unprecedented rainfall to the northeast U.S. in September 2021. The flood extent resulting from this rainfall has largely not been mapped. In this study we used Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and a Random Forest machine learning model to map floods in southeastern Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, Montgomery, Delaware, Bucks counties). 

Flooding in urban areas are routinely understudied due their complex hydrology. This study addresses this complexity by using multiple datasets in addition to satellite imagery as inputs to the model. This study also created a novel flood extent map for urban counties that did not have one. Now emergency planners, city planners, and every day residents can use the flood extent map to prepare for future flood events.
