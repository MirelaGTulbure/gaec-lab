NASA brought attention to research done by the Geospatial Analysis for Environmental Change Lab, as posted about  <a href = "../22-02-08-nasa-first/"> here </a>. This research was funded by NASA and the resulting paper, <a href = "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271622000338"> Can we detect more ephemeral floods with higher density harmonized Landsat Sentinel 2 data compared to Landsat 8 alone? </a>, was accepted on January 28, 2022 in ISPRS Journal of Photogrammerty and Remote Sensing.
