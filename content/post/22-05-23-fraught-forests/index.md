From the article, 
"But what happens to a tree’s appetite during periods of drought in what has typically been one of the Southeast’s soggiest ecosystems? 

The answer is that ridge-top forests are particularly greedy drinkers when it’s dry, according to three N.C. State University researchers in the Department of Forestry and Environmental Resources — doctoral student and lead researcher Katie McQuillan, and faculty co-authors Katherine Martin and Mirela Tulbure, who recently published their results in the journal Landscape Ecology."
