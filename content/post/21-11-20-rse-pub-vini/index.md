Vini's 2nd paper employed a novel algorithm based on the Kalman filter to comnine PlanetScope, RapidEye, Sentinel 2, and Sentinel 1 imagery to monitor the sub-weekly surface area of on-farm reservoirs. When the algorithm was applied across 736 on-farm reservoirs in eastern Arkansas, the resulting surface area time series had <5% error for most reservoirs.
