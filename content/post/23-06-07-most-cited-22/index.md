In 2021-2022 the top cited paper in Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation was <i>Regional matters: On the usefulness of regional land-cover datasets in times of global change</i>.

<!--more-->
This paper outlines the advantages and disadvantages of regional and global land-cover and land-use datasets. Both regional and global datasets serve a purpose, with regional data providing additional specificity that is required for policy making. They discuss five themes of regional and global land-use datasets: (1) thematic resolution, (2) consistency of class legends, (3) temporal resolution, (4) training and validation algorithms, (5) accuracy and uncertainty. The paper also makes recommendations for land-use products derived from Earth Observation (EO) data. A few of those recommendations include ensuring the global and regional land-use products are compatible and nested, doing more consistent ground data collection and conducting regional accuracy assessments.
