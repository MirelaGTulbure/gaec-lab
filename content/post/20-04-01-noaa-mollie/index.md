The ten week internship is located at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) Center for Weather and Climate Prediction (NCWCP) in College Park, Maryland. Mollie will be working with Drs Helin Wei and Yulong Xia in the Environmental Modeling Center (EMC) to use the International Soil Moisture Network to evaluate retrospective and real-time Global Forecasting System version 16 (GFS V16). In addition to this project, she will also participate in workshops designed to build the skills and knowledge of the interns relevant to working in a federal research facility. She will also attend lectures and network with current federal researchers and present her work in written and oral forms at the end of the summer. She is looking forward to embracing this opportunity, which is scheduled to begin in early June in person or remotely depending on the state of the COVID-19 pandemic.
