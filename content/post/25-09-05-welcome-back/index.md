The GAEC lab is excited to begin a new semester and continue work on our ongoing NASA-funded research projects.

Dr. Varun Tiwari left the lab in the spring after <a href = "https://gaec-lab.netlify.app/post/25-04-08-varun-defense/">successfully defending his PhD</a>. Still with the lab (from left to right) are postdoctoral research scholars, Drs. Mollie D. Gaines and Júlio Caineta (not in the photo), PhD student Emma Vail, PhD candidate Rebecca Composto, Research Assistant Om Jain (not in the photo), and undergraduate research assistant Darcy Boast. Darcy was recently accepted into the new Interdisciplinary Geospatial Research Opportunities Undergraduate Program (<a href = "https://cnr.ncsu.edu/geospatial/i-group/">I-GROUP</a>). 

We look forward to continuing our research this academic year with the guidance of principal investigator Dr. Mirela G. Tulbure.
