Field work sampling ponds across North Carolina has begun.

<!--more-->

Throughout the summer the team will be collecting data and travelling to small water bodies around North Carolina. PhD Candidate Varun Tiwari is part of this team and has travelled to remote corners of North Carolina to sample ponds. This collection process entails kayaking to the center of the pond (along with battling the summer heat). You can check out more photos from the field <a href="https://x.com/varunkt1/status/1794789776702504978">here</a>.

These samples are a part of an ongoing project funded by a NASA Commercial Smallsat Data Scientific Analysis (Grant Number 80NSSC24K0053). This project aims to provide better annual regional methane estimates from small water bodies in the Southeastern US.
