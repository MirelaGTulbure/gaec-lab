The <a href = 'https://provost.ncsu.edu/ofe/awards-and-honors/university-faculty-scholars/'>University Faculty Scholars Program</a> recognizes early- and mid-career faculty for their outstanding achievements and contributions to NC State. Nominated faculty are evaluated on research and scholarship productivity, excellence in teaching and mentoring, and leadership in extension, professional societies, and public service initiatives.

Dr. Tulbure, a Chancellorâ€™s Faculty Excellence Program Professor in Geospatial Analytics, leads the Geospatial Analysis for Environmental Change Lab, using satellite data and machine learning to quantify flood risk and surface water dynamics. She is an international thought leader in her discipline, presenting at universities and conferences worldwide. Dr. Tulbure is acclaimed for her ability to translate cutting-edge science into solutions for real-world challenges. Her collaborative work with a small, low-income community in rural Georgia resulted in updated flood maps that empowered residents to advocate for vital flood mitigation infrastructure. Her commitment to extending science beyond campus benefits local communities and prepares students and future science professionals to replicate these efforts in flood-prone regions in North Carolina and beyond.
