Varun has progressed to being a PhD Candidate with his dissertation entitled, 'Leveraging Satellite Data and Machine Learning for Understanding and Quantifying the Linkage Between Flooding, Food Security, and Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Rice Cultivation in Bangladesh'

<!--more-->

His Ph.D. research focuses on employing Machine Learning to study the linkage between flooding, food security, and greenhouse gas emissions in the rice cultivation of Bangladesh. Specifically, Varun aims to achieve this through four objectives: generating weekly surface water and flood maps, quantifying methane emissions using satellite data and machine learning algorithms, mapping rice yield through remote sensing and machine learning, and developing a framework emphasizing the impact of agricultural flooding using time-series SAR data. In the future, he hopes to work for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, where he would aim to address real-world problems.
