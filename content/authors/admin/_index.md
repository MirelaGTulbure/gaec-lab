I am a Professor with <a href = "https://cnr.ncsu.edu/geospatial/"> the Center for Geospatial Analytics </a> at North Carolina State University (NCSU). 

I relocated to NCSU in Aug 2019 from the University of New South Wales (Sydney, Australia) where I had a faculty position and built the Geospatial Analysis for Environmental Change Lab. 

I am a geospatial data scientist with 10 years of experience post-PhD in the higher education
research sector. I work to improve understanding of flooding and surface water dynamics
and their drivers of change (e.g., climate and land-use) at regional to global scales. I develop
machine-learning pipelines based on terabytes of satellite imagery using cloud computing.
Results of my work can underpin water policy and management in areas with competing water demands and conservation decisions.  In my prior work I have translated my research findings to government organizations, which have attested the importance of my work for policy and management decisions.
