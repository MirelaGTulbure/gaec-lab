Robbi currently works with Geoscience Australia's earth observation team. While working with the lab, he pursued his  interest in the natural world and the role landscape-scale research has to play in maintaining the viability of ecosystems increasingly impacted by development and environmental change. Particularly, he focused on how dynamic remote sensing datasets and network analysis can be used to study landscape connectivity through time and across large spatial extents, potentially providing a powerful and efficient mechanism for prioritising conservation within highly modified and increasingly contested landscapes.

<b>Past Projects</b>
Robbi's research focuses on modelling ecological connectivity between surface water habitats of the Murray-Darling Basin, one of the largest semi-arid agricultural basins in the world (> 1 million km2) and home to many of Australia's most significant freshwater ecosystems. Robbi uses graph theory network modelling to analyse connectivity, an advanced statistical framework which has recently seen a rapid uptake for analysing connectivity in terrestrial, marine and surface water systems. By combining graph theory modelling with over 25 years of newly available high-resolution remotely sensed surface-water datasets, this work will attempt to characterise spatiotemporal connectivity dynamics across the Murray-Darling at seasonal, yearly and decadal scales. It is anticipated the results of this research will contribute to current understanding of how habitat network structure, landscape conditions and dynamic events such as flooding combine to influence connectivity across space and time, and ultimately assist in prioritising critical surface water habitats for conservation

From 2011 to 2013, Robbi worked collaboratively with an international team of environmental scientists, GIS specialists and landscape archaeologists on the Tundzha Regional Archaeological Project. He helped to design and conduct a multi-disciplinary geoarchaeological project involving extensive field work aimed at studying the paleoenvironmental landscape of an archaeologically significant region of central Bulgaria. During his Honours year, datasets collected in Bulgaria were analysed to model the socio-ecological consequences of past human habitation at varying temporal and spatial scales, and explore the dynamic and synergistic effects of climate change and agricultural intensification on historic land use patterns.
