I am a computational geoscientist with a focus on remote sensing and machine learning applications
to hydrology (surface and groundwater). I have joined the Geospatial Analysis for Environmental Change Lab to 
work on the mapping of flooding dynamics and in the assessment of the impact on affected communities and
critical infrastructure.
