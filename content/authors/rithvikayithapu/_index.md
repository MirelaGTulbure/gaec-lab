With a strong foundation in computer science, I am interested in developing scalable solutions and optimizing software performance. My technical expertise spans a range of programming languages, including Python, Go, Java, and TypeScript, complemented by experience with frameworks and tools like React, Spring Boot, Kubernetes, and Docker. I thrive in environments requiring analytical thinking and attention to detail. My ability to harness cloud technologies such as AWS and MongoDB allows me to craft innovative solutions for challenging problems.

I enjoy tackling complex challenges with a methodical approach. My experience also includes debugging critical issues, and mentoring team members, which has helped me grow both technically and personally. Currently I am diving deep into AWS services to leverage them for the lab. I am excited to learn more about the geospatial domain and apply modern machine learning techniques to extract insights.
