I am a senior at North Carolina State University (NC State) studying Statistics with a Minor in Industrial Engineering. My undergraduate career has largely been focused on statistical training and applications across many disciplines. I am interested in applying statistical learning techniques to geospatial analysis for environmental and social good.
