My research work focuses on evaluating the impacts of floods on rice crops in Bangladesh. In the past, I have also worked as Remote Sensing and GIS analyst at International Center for Integrated Mountain development, Nepal. My research area includes the use of optical, Hyperspectral, SAR remote sensing for surface water and crop type mapping.
