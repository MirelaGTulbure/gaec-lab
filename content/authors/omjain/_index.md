I'm a driven Software Engineer with a keen interest in leveraging technology to tackle real-world challenges and enhance societal well-being. I find immense satisfaction in delving into the intricacies of new technologies, understanding their architectures, and employing them to craft innovative solutions. While I'm deeply invested in grasping the broader view of system architecture, my primary focus remains on deciphering critical components to drive impactful outcomes.

With expertise in Python, Java, React, Node.js, and Spring, I am currently expanding my knowledge of various AWS services, which I will apply to research projects at this lab. As a research assistant, my role involves retrieving flood images from a satellite database and processing them using AWS services. I am excited to delve into the geospatial domain and uncover valuable insights.
