Valentin currently works as a Post Doctoral Researcher in Hydrology at UNSW. 
As a researcher at GAEC, he was interested in the application of Earth observation data, remote sensing and statistical modeling for improving water resources management on globally significant scales. He was particularly passionate about the important role of innovative research and technology in providing the scientific evidence that is urgently needed for addressing the proliferation of the global freshwater crisis by informed policy making.

<b>Past Projects</b>
In his PhD at UNSW, he modelled surface water and inundation dynamics on large river basin scale, using a unique time-series of remotely-sensed surface water maps derived from Landsat imagery (1986 - 2012). This time-series was used in combination with river flow data and spatially explicit time-series of rainfall, evapotranspiration and soil-moisture, to perform a holistic analysis of the spatial and temporal distribution of surface water and its drivers across the Murray-Darling Basin, Australiaâ€™s largest and most important river basin. The resulting surface water models provide new insights into hydrological surface processes on sub-continental scale such as the retention and drying behaviour of large floodplains, the propagation of floods over large areas and the role of local rainfall, evapotranspiration and soil moisture for surface water dynamics. He then worked to incorporate MODIS data into the modeling framework to improve the models' ability to catpure rapid changes in flooding extent. 

In the first year of his PhD, he developed a new approach for modeling flooding dynamics across large river basins by combining a variety of satellite and in-situ data sets. The framework is highly-automated and easily applicable to other large river basins across the world such as the Amazon or Congo river basin. Details of the approach are given in the corresponding publication in <a href="https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/20/2227/2016/"> Hydrology and Earth System Sciences. </a>

In his second year, he added additional capabilities to the above-mentioned modeling approach and applied the new framework to model flooding dynamics and the role of hydrological key drivers in these dynamics across the entire Murray-Darling Basin, Australia's largest developed river system. The novel statistical modeling approach allowed us to accurately model the relationship between river flow and inundation extent across all major river and floodplain systems in the basin and revealed that in addition to river flow, local climate conditions influence the long-term dynamics of surface water particularly in the extended and unregulated floodplain systems in the northwest of the basin. Details of this modeling application are given in the corresponding publication in <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016WR019858"> Water Resources Research. </a>

 His Master's thesis was part of the interdisciplinary research project "Urban Strategies for Onaville" at Technical University of Munich. In this study, he used GIS-based hydrologic and hydraulic modelling for estimating the flood hazard of the informal settlement Onaville (image below), which is a fairly new and rapidly growing informal settlement in Haiti that is exposed to dangerous flash-flood events.
