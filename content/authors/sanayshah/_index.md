I am a <strong>Computer Science</strong> Master's student at NC State University and Research Assistant at the Geospatial Analysis for Environmental Change Lab. My work at Geospatial Analysis for Environmental Change Lab involves <strong>optimizing code</strong> and applying <strong>machine learning skills</strong> to satellite imagery. 

Using my <strong>programming skills, image processing and machine learning techniques</strong> I aim to help advance the lab's environmental change research on surface water, flooding, climate impacts, and environmental justice.
