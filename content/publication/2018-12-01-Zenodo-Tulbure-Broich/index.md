abstract: Please refer to the above mentioned publication for a description of the data and interpretation of the patterns. The animations are based on statistically validated surface water and flooding extent dynamics data derived from seasonally continous Landsat TM/ETM+ and random forest models from 1986 to 2011 over Australia's Murray-Darling Basin. The overall accuracy was over 99% and producer's accuracy for water 87% +/- 3%.
