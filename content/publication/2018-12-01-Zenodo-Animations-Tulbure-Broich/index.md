abstract: The animations provided here are part of the publication,<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969718347466">[Tulbure, M.G. and M. Broich (2018)]</a>. The method is described in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425716300621">[Tulbure et al. (2016)]</a>. The animations are based on statistically validated surface water and flooding extent dynamics data derived from seasonally continous Landsat TM/ETM+ and random forest models from 1986 to 2011 over Australia's Murray-Darling Basin. The overall accuracy was over 99% and producer's accuracy for water 87% +/- 3%.
