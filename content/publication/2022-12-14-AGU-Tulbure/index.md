abstract: Floods are the worst weather-related natural disasters that affect vulnerable populations and impact assets. Disaster response management requires near real-time accurate information on flood occurrence based on Earth Observation (EO) data. However, in spite of recent advancements in mapping surface water with EO data, floods are more difficult to map and quantify their impacts compared to surface water because floods are ephemeral, their spectral signatures are more complex than those of surface water (i.e., due to turbidity, bottom reflectance, etc.), and optical EO data, the most common data type used so far in flood mapping, are cloud contaminated during floods. Taking advantage of complementary sensors (Synthetic Aperture Radar, SAR, and optical data) to alleviate the challenges faced when mapping floods, here we used Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 data coinciding with known global floods events to map floods and quantify their impact on assets and populations.
We present results of our flood mapping based on a new, harmonized global flood training dataset, leveraging machine learning algorithms. We further quantify the impacts of floods on land cover and land use, populations, and assets. Results show that using data from the 2 sensors combined improves accuracies when mapping global flood events compared to each sensor individually. Among the land cover land use besides water, impervious surfaces were affected by floods. Future work will provide a more detailed analysis focusing on socio-economic impacts of floods.
