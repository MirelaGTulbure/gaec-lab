This project determined how ecosystems respond to environmental flow by linking flooding history with vegetation responses, using remote sensing, climate data layers, spatial statistics, models of environmental flows, and ecological theory. Beneficiaries included water and land managers in Australia.

In this project we used satellite data and high-performance computing to quantify surface water dynamics, currently focusing on Australia’s MDB – the most important basin in Australia for crop production, wetlands and biodiversity – allowing us to trace patterns in water extent over decades and across large areas. More specifically, we have developed the first spatially detailed and seasonally continuous surface water and flooding extent dynamics quantification at sub-continental scale (MDB) at the highest available temporal (every 16-days) and unprecedented spatial resolution (30m) by processing ~5TB (25,000 compressed images) of Landsat satellite data over three decades (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0034425716300621?via%3Dihub">Tulbure et al 2016</a>). Highlights of this work were featured by <a href="http://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/?p=1246">NASA Landsat Science</a>, chosen as <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=88292">NASA’s image of the day</a> in July 2016, in Australia by <a href="http://ozewex.org/?p=1111">OzEWEX</a> and featured on the <a href="http://www.arc.gov.au/boom-and-bust-water-supplies-southeast-australia">ARC website</a> as part of research highlights. This work allowed us to quantify the basin’s dramatically changing expanse of surface water and showed how the Millennium Drought and following La Niña deluges impacted surface water throughout the MDB. For this work, Dr. Tulbure was awarded the New South Wales Young Tall Poppy Science Award for outstanding research by an early career researcher from the Australian Institute of Policy and Science. We showed that besides extreme climate variability land-use is as important in driving surface water extent dynamics (Tulbure and Broich, In Review).

We used this surface water time-series in a spatial modeling framework (<a href="https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/20/2227/2016/">Heimhuber, Tulbure, Broich 2016</a>) to develop statistical flood modeling as a function of hydro-climatic variables (river flow, rainfall, soil moisture, evapotranspiration). We showed that in addition to river flow, local climate conditions influence the long-term dynamics of surface water, particularly in the extended and unregulated floodplain systems in the northwest of the basin (<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2016WR019858">Heimhuber, Tulbure, Broich 2017</a>).  We are currently using GRACE data to understand the long-term decline in ground water in the MDB and how it relates to our Landsat-derived surface water dynamics and water salinity (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0303243418310675">Heimhuber, Tulbure, Broich, Xie, Hurryet, 2019</a>).
