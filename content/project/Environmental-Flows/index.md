summary: We integrated analyzing time-series of satellite and hydro-climatic data to quantify flooding, surface water, and their drivers of change and vegetation response to flooding across Australia’s breadbasket, the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), a large  (>1 million km2) dryland basin the size of the U.S. 4 corner states from 1986 to 2011. The three decades investigated represented a period of extreme hydroclimatic variability, including the Millennium Drought (1999-2009), the worst drought recorded for southeastern Australia, followed by some of the wettest years on record (2010-11 La Niña years).

We analyzed time-series of satellite and hydro-climatic data to quantify flooding, surface water, and their drivers of change and vegetation response to flooding across Australia’s breadbasket, the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), a large  (>1 million km2) dryland basin the size of the U.S. 4 corner states from 1986 to 2011. The three decades investigated represented a period of extreme hydroclimatic variability, including the Millennium Drought (1999-2009), the worst drought recorded for southeastern Australia, followed by some of the wettest years on record (2010-11 La Niña years).  Specific objectives included: 
 
<b>SURFACE WATER DYNAMICS ACROSS SPACE AND TIME</b><br>
 We used satellite data and high-performance computing to develop the first spatially detailed and seasonally continuous surface water and flooding extent dynamics quantification at sub-continental scale at then the highest available temporal (every 16-days) and spatial resolution (30m) by processing ~5TB (25,000 compressed images) of Landsat satellite data over three decades (<a href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/science/article/pii/S0034425716300621">Tulbure et al. 2016</a>). Highlights of this work were featured by NASA Landsat Science here and chosen as NASA’s image of the day in July 2016, see here.
 This work allowed us to quantify the basin’s dramatically changing expanse of surface water and show how the Millennium Drought and following La Niña deluges impacted surface water throughout the MDB. 
 We made the satellite-derived surface water and flooding dynamics datasets freely available (<a href="http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2441784">Tulbure and Broich, 2019</a>).

We then showed that besides extreme climate variability, land use is as important in driving surface water extent dynamics, particularly at the local scale, suggesting that measures that we can implement locally based on decisions on how we use our land can have a significant impact on water extent dynamics (<a href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/science/article/pii/S0048969718347466">Tulbure and Broich, 2019</a>).

<b>DRIVERS OF SURFACE WATER DYNAMICS</b><br>
 We used the time series of surface water and flooding dynamics derived above in a spatial modeling framework (<a href="https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/20/2227/2016/">Heimhuber et al. 2016</a>) to develop statistical flood modeling as a function of hydro-climatic variables (river flow, rainfall, soil moisture, evapotranspiration). We showed that in addition to river flow, local climate conditions influence the long-term dynamics of surface water, particularly in the extended and unregulated floodplain systems in the northwest of the basin (<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016WR019858">Heimhuber et al. 2017</a>).  To overcome the challenge of not being able to capture ephemeral floods with the 16-day revisit period of Landsat, we showed that statistical models and image blending () can produce consistent 8-day 30 m inundation mapping (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0034425718301603">Heimhuber et al. 2018</a>). 
 We also used GRACE data to understand how the long-term total water storage anomalies were related to stream salinity trends (<a href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/science/article/pii/S0303243418310675">Heimhuber et al. 2019</a>).


<b>VEGETATION RESPONSE TO FLOODING</b><br>
 First, we quantified how vegetation responds to flooding across the entire MDB. Second, we quantified floodplain tree dieback using airborne LiDAR, and hyperspectral data and its relationship with flooding (derived above from Landsat time series). To achieve this aim, we developed novel algorithms to map individual trees from the LiDAR point cloud (<a href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/science/article/pii/S0034425715301966">Shendryk et al. 2016</a>) and then used the delineated trees to classify their dieback using random forest algorithms based on field, airborne LiDAR and hyperspectral data (<a href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/science/article/pii/S0034425715301966">Shendryk et al. 2016</a>). We upscaled this information to the site level using radar, very-high-resolution imagery, and LiDAR (<a href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/science/article/pii/S0303243418303155">Shendryk et al. 2018</a>).

 This project determined how ecosystems respond to environmental flow by linking flooding history with vegetation responses, using remote sensing, climate data layers, spatial statistics, models of environmental flows, and ecological theory. Beneficiaries included water and land managers in Australia. Through this project, we built strong collaborations with policy relevance by working with the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, the federal agency in charge of managing the scarce water resources of the MDB.

The Australian Research Council supported this work through a Linkage Project in collaboration with the Murray-Darling Basin Authority [<a href="http://LP130100408">Grant Number LP130100408</a>].
