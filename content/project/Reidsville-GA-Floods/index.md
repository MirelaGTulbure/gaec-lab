summary: Reidsville GA Community Floods, a small community group, seeks to prevent residential flooding in Reidsville, GA. This community science project will help residents understand their flood risks and the potential for green infrastructure as a step toward this greater goal. In parallel with the group’s existing partnerships that are investigating county-level flooding, the outcomes of this project are to 1) create a map that outlines flood risk in the community 2) better understand the potential for green infrastructure, including replicable green infrastructure on private property.

Our lab volunteered our time and expertise as part of AGU's <a href="https://thrivingearthexchange.org/project/reidsville-ga/">Thriving Earth Exchange</a> which helps connect communities with resources and experts to address issues impacting their community. We worked to help a vulnerable community in Reidsville, Georgia with flood mapping.

One of the final products of this project is a story map created so that the community can learn about flooding in their area and how we were able to measure and document the flooding using satellite imagery. Take a look <a href="https://arcg.is/1HC9v82">here</a>.
