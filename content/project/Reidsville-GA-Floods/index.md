Our lab volunteered our time and expertise as part of AGU's <a href="https://thrivingearthexchange.org/project/reidsville-ga/">Thriving Earth Exchange</a> which helps connect communities with resources and experts to address issues impacting their community. We worked to help a vulnerable community in Reidsville, Georgia with flood mapping.

One of the final products of this project is a story map created so that the community can learn about flooding in their area and how we were able to measure and document the flooding using satellite imagery. Take a look <a href="https://arcg.is/1HC9v82">here</a>.
