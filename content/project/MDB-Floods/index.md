Project focused on quantifying surface water and flooding extent dynamics at sub-continental scale (e.g., the Murray-Darling River Basin (MDB), one of the largest dryland basins in the world), assessing drivers of flooding dynamics, quantifying spactiotemporal connectivity of surface water habitats using network analysis, quantifying vegetation response to flooding, and characterising vegetation health using airborne lidar and hyperspectral and satellite time series data. More specifically, I have developed the first spatially detailed and seasonally continuous surface water and flooding extent dynamics quantification at sub-continental scale at then the highest available temporal (every 16-days) and unprecedented spatial resolution (30m) by processing ~5TB (25,000 compressed images) of Landsat satellite data over three decades ([Tulbure et al. 2016](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299372495_Surface_Water_Extent_Dynamics_from_Three_Decades_of_Seasonally_Continuous_Landsat_Time_Series_at_Subcontinental_Scale_in_a_Semi-Arid_Region)). Highlights of this work were featured by [NASA Landsat Science](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/article/thirsting-equitable-water-distribution-australia-turns-landsat), chosen as [NASA’s image of the day](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/88292/boom-and-bust-water-supplies-in-southeast-australia) in July 2016, in Australia by OzEWEX and featured on the ARC website as part of research highlights. This work allowed me to quantify the basin’s dramatically changing expanse of surface water and showed how the Millennium Drought and following La Niña deluges impacted surface water throughout the MDB. For this work, I was awarded the New South Wales Young Tall Poppy Science Award for outstanding research by an early career researcher from the Australian Institute of Policy and Science. I then showed that besides extreme climate variability, land-use is as important in driving surface water extent dynamics, particularly at local scales, suggesting that measures that we can implement locally based on decision on how we use our land can have a significant impact on water quantity dynamics ([Tulbure and Broich, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969718347466)). 

Other prior work has focused on the southwest of Western Australia (one of the 25 global biodiversity hotspots in the world, see [Tulbure and Broich (2013)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924271613000300) and [Tulbure et al. (2014)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/9/11/114012/meta)), the U.S. Great Lakes and Northern Great Plains and the Danube River Basin.
